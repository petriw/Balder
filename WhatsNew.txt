
Version 0.8.8.5

* Introduced Silverlight in Core, but still maintaining platform independence
  - Using core objects directly in Xaml can now be done

* Removed all controls in Balder.Core.Silverlight.Controls - not needed anymore

* Introduced View namespace with IView interface and Camera implementing it

* Viewport has View property insted of Camera

* Moved rendering from a multithread environment to run synchronously on the CompositionTarget.
  It gives better performance, due to synchronization issues between all threads. Will be 
  revisited in the future.
